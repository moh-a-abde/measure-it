"""The LLM judge: a second model call that reads a rationale and answers a rubric.

A starter is written: one rubric question, one model call, JSON out. Deliverable 2.2 is
to extend RUBRIC and validate the judge against your own labels (3.2). The judge is a
model call, so its verdicts are recorded as fixtures by judge.py and read by score.py;
score.py never calls a model.
